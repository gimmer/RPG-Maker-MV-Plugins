## Gimmer_TextAnywhere

Fill in an array of text variables, and that text will show anywhere on the screen.
Has all the same replaces as the base text (like \V for variable, \N for actor name, and \G for currency unit)

### Text Tutorial:

You will require the following items:
* js/plugins: Gimmer_Core for the scaffolding needed to run this.
* js/plugins: Gimmer_TextAnywhere

In the plugin menu, go into the texts variable, and use the built in structure to provide X, Y, text, color, and fontsize variables

Text will show continuously on the map screen.

Optionally, you can bind keyboard or mouse buttons to make the UI appear
