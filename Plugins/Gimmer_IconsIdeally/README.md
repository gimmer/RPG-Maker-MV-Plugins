## Gimmer_IconsIdeally

Allows you to define a Icons.json to define specific text strings that, 
if found in a Show Text or Battle Log command, will automatically be prefixed by certain icons.

An example Icons.json file can be found in the repo. Its format is pretty simplistic, just an object with word as key, 
and an iconId as value.

You can choose if you want the icons to work in battle, show text, or both.

#### Text Tutorial:

1. Fill out the Icons.json file with simple "TEXT":iconId pairs. See the file for an example
2. Add Show Text commands
3. Watch the icons appear!
4. (Optional) Don't want an icon on a word? Prefix it with an "!"
