## Gimmer_Idle

Allows you to setup characters, followers, and events to have idle animations.

#### Text Tutorial:

Put a note tag on the character / event that reads:
\<idleImage:[characterName],[characterIndex]>

Where you replace [characterName] with the Sprite Sheet the idle animation is and [characterIndex] with the position in that sheet (0 through 7 on regular sheets, always 0 for big sheets)

Plugin parameters let you choose how many frames before the idle animation will start.
