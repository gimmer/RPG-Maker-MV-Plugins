### Gimmer_MapPreload

This plugin attempts to detect adjacent maps to the map the player is currently on and preloads them into memory.

This prevents the need to rig assets at transfer time, speeding up load times.

Only been tested with small projects, and the benefits may be very small.

## Terms of Use:

Free for both commercial and non-commercial use, with credit.
