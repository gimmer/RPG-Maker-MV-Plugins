### Gimmer_MatchingFaces

This plugin lets you set a meta parameter on any Actor in the database "<faceName: String>".

 You can set as many actors as you want with a similar stem, deliminated by a dash:
* Hero
* Hero-Armour
* Hero-Naked
* etc.

 Then, in the "Show Text", you can use the faceName of "hero" for all lines of dialog for the hero character, and depending on which variant is in your party the correct portrait will show
