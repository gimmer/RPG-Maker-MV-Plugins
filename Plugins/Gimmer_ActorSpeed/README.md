## Gimmer_ActorSpeed

Allows you to set your actor speed to a decimal value.

#### Text Tutorial:

Set the "Actor Speed" parameter to any number you want (switch the input type to "text" if you want to use a fraction)

Optionally, toggle "Return Actor Speed" to true if you want your player to move back to this speed after any move routes in events without you having to specify so manually

## Terms of Use:

Free for both commercial and non-commercial use, with credit.
