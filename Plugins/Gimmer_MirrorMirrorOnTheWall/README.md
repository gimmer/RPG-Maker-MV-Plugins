## Gimmer_MirrorMirrorOnTheWall

Plugin to create mirrors on the map

1. Create a transparent tile on the map
2. Put an event on the map. It can have a tile if you want, but that tile needs to be at least somewhat translucent
3. Add <mirror> to the event's note tag.
4. Walk in front of the tile, see the reflection!

Any event with a _characterName set will be reflected in the mirror.
Tiles in front of the mirror will be reflected

####Note: Tiles are not inverted when reflected, try to make the terrain direction agnostic when in front of a mirror
