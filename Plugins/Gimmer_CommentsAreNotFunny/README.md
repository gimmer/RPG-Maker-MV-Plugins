## Gimmer_CommentsAreNotFunny

Temporarily disable lines of events by wrapping them in comments.

Not really meant to be enabled and shipped with a live game, but can help debugging by wrapping code you don't want to have to fire again and again during testing.

Requires Gimmer_Core

### Text Tutorial

1. Install plugin
2. In the event page, before the start of parts of the event you don't want to fire, add a comment with the body:
   `/*`
3. After the bit you want to skip, put in a comment with the body:
`*/`
4. Run the game as normal.
